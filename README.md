# Student Grade
  This assignment requires one to create a js program which gives various grades based on students' marks. When the marks are below 40 points, the program should assign the student an "E" grade. If the student scores between 40 and 49 points, the programs should assign a grade of "D". If the score is between 49 and 59 points, a grade of "C" is assigned. A range of between 60 and 79 points attracts a "B" grade. Lastly, students scoring above 79 points are awarded an "A" grade by the program.

# Speed
 This assignment requires one to create a js program which gives various responses based on the driver's speed. When the speed is below 70km/s, the programs prints a response titled "Ok". However, for every 5km/s that the driver exceeds the speed limit of 70 km/s, the program should print a demerit. When the points accumulate to 12, which equals 130km/s, the program should print a response titled "License Suspended"
